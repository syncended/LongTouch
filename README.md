# LongTouch
## What is that?
**Long Touch** is an android application, that allow you use your android device as Mouse.
## Prototype
Prototype was [WifiMouseAndroid](https://github.com/syncended/WifiMouseAndroid). Old client has a lot of bugs, and written on Android Support Library.
Few moments ago my notebook touchpad was broken, and I've understood how old client is uncomfortable.
## Additional software
Soon i'll write new clien for that application, now it works on [WifiMousePc](https://github.com/syncended/WifiMousePC) client.
